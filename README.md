# Lipizzan-horses-final-results
We present the final results of the Lipizzaner breed project study with an iterative approach to finding the most important characteristics for analyzing the reactivity and personality of Lipizzaner horses.

This research project funded by the Slovenian Research And Innovation Agency (J7-3154)

To run the code you need to create an enviroment with certain requirements (requirements.txt) This code is provided in Jupiter Notebook format.

*.xlsx files store the necessary data (don't change them!)

Lipizzan_LOO_DT101_reactivity.ipynb is an implementation of the LOOM algorithm for a decision tree model for reactivity analysis based on Lipizzan horse data.

Lipizzan_LOO_DT101_personality.ipynb is an implementation of the LOOM algorithm for a decision tree model for perconality analysis based on Lipizzan horse data.
